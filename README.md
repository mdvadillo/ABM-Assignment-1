# ABM-Assignment-1

The agents.py[] contains code for agents' behavior. We have 4 types of agents overall. Each agent gets assigned one of two groups in each dimension, in a model with two dimensions total. Agents can be have $type_1 = 0 & type_2 = 0$,  $type_1 = 1 & type_2 = 0$, $type_1 = 0 & type_2 = 1$, and $type_1 = 1 & type_2 = 1$

model.py constains the model, takes in model parameters and creates the agents. 

server.py [] creates the visualization

run.py runs the model
